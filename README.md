a WIP limit of 3.
There are currently 3 items in testing (3 items being
tested). Similarly, there are 3 items in the development column (2 items that are in development and 1
item is done with its development).
One of the developers does not have anything to work

the development column so the developer looking for
work can work on it.

we are building, we effectively hard-coded the game
to ask the user what action to take next, for both

we build out the game.
Now, however, we want to add a new player type to the
system, EasyDifficultyBot. While the "player" actions
fit the same high-level format for both humans and
our AI, the details of making it happen vary pretty
widely.
